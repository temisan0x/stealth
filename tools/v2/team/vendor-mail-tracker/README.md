# Vendor Mail Tracker

Vendor Mail Tracker is an isolated V2 team tool workspace for tracking vendor
communications, outstanding replies, blockers, and follow-up ownership before a
future mail-app integration.

## Ownership Boundary

All work for this tool must stay inside:

```text
tools/v2/team/vendor-mail-tracker/
```

Do not wire this tool into the main app, routing, inbox architecture, wallet
core, Stellar core, database schema, or shared design system unless a future
integration issue explicitly allows it.

## Reviewer Setup

This issue adds folder-local documentation, fixtures, and a standalone Node test.
No app install is required to review the contribution.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
node --test tools/v2/team/vendor-mail-tracker/tests/vendor-mail-fixtures.test.mjs
```

The test validates the sample vendor-mail fixture against the local review
contract described in `specs.md`.

## Tracking Workflow

1. Capture vendor messages from synthetic email records.
2. Normalize each thread into vendor, owner, status, last contact, and due date.
3. Route each thread to `open`, `waiting-on-vendor`, `blocked`, or `resolved`.
4. Preserve a source message id for traceability.
5. Flag stale, blocked, or high-priority vendor threads for human review.

## Fixtures

The folder-local fixture at `fixtures/sample-vendor-mails.json` contains:

- an open onboarding thread that needs an internal owner response
- a waiting-on-vendor thread with a pending security questionnaire
- a blocked invoice thread missing required documentation
- a resolved renewal thread with complete owner evidence

The fixture intentionally uses `example.test` addresses, synthetic vendor names,
and fake thread ids so contributors can validate behavior without using real
vendor, invoice, customer, or mailbox data.

## Documentation Map

- `specs.md` defines the local vendor-mail tracking contract and scope.
- `docs/test-plan.md` lists automated and manual review steps.
- `docs/review-notes.md` explains validation and known limits.
- `tests/vendor-mail-fixtures.test.mjs` validates the fixture contract.

## Known Limitations

- This contribution does not add app UI or live mailbox ingestion.
- Tracking behavior is represented through fixture expectations only.
- Vendor authentication, attachment storage, billing workflows, and
  notifications remain out of scope for this isolated V2 folder.
