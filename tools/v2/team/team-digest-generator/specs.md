# Team Digest Generator - Specs

## Purpose

Generate daily summaries of team emails for quick review and digest.

Generate a daily team digest that summarizes email activity, pending items, completed work, and team member contributions — all within an isolated workspace, with no dependency on the main Stealth Mail application.
